# Sage User Guide

Welcome to Sage, your personal finance app for understanding and managing your spending, income, and budgets. Sage is a local-only reporting tool that helps you make informed financial decisions without moving money or tracking investments.

## What is Sage?
Sage helps you:

- Understand how you are spending your money
- Track how your income and spending change over time
- Define and monitor budgets
- Receive actionable financial advice (e.g., which loans to pay off first)

Sage does not connect to bank accounts or move money. It is strictly a reporting and analysis tool.
