# Importing Statements

Sage supports importing transaction history from CSV files exported from your financial institutions.

## Supported Institutions
- Chase (checking, savings, credit card)
- Charles Schwab (brokerage, checking)
- Fidelity (brokerage, credit card)
- Target (credit card)
- Bank of America (credit card)
- UW Credit Union (mortgage)
- Capital One (credit card, savings)

Sage includes dedicated parsing logic for these institutions. Simply export your recent transaction history as a CSV from your bankâ€™s website and import it into Sage. No manual editing is typically required.

If you encounter issues with a CSV, check that it matches the format exported by your institution. For unsupported formats, manual editing may be necessary.
