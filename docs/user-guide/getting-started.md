# Getting Started

Sage is a local-only application. No account or login is required. All your data stays on your device.

## Main Workflows
- **Add new accounts**: Set up your financial accounts in Sage.
- **Import statements**: Bring in your transaction history using CSV files.
- **Update balances**: Keep your account balances current.
- **Categorize transactions**: Organize your spending for better insights.
- **View reports**: Analyze your finances with built-in reports.

All data is stored locally in the `sage.db` file. Remember to back up this file periodically to avoid data loss.
